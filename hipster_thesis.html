    	<h2 class="cn">Overview</h2>
    	<p class="para">Hipster refers to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture">subculture</a> of young, urban middle class adults and older teenagers that appeared in the<br>
    	1990s. The subculture us associated with independent music, a varied non-mainstream fashion sensibility,<br>
    	progressive[1][2] or indepepdent political views, alternative spirituality or atheism/agnosticism, and<br>
    	alternative lifestyles. Interests in media include independent film, magazines such as Clash, and websites<br>
    	like Pitchfork Media.</p>
    	<h2 class="cn">What the Heck is a Hipster?</h2>
    	<p class="para">Hipster culture has been described as a "mutating, trans-Atlantic melting pot of styles, tastes and<br>
    	behavior[s]".[3] Christian Lorentzen of Time Out New York argues that "hipsterism fetishizes the<br>
    	authentic" elements of all the "fringe movements of the postwar eraâ€"beat, hippie, punk, even<br>
    	grunge", and draws on the "cultural stores of every unmelted ehtnicity", and "regurgitates it with a<br>
    	winking inauthenticity".</p>
